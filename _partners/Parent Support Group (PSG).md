Our Parent Support Group (PSG) was formed in 1999 to promote parenting skills and enable active parents’ involvement in the school programmes and activities.

The PSG believes that a strong partnership between parents and the school is essential to fostering our students' success. Built on trust and shared responsibilities, this collaboration offers valuable insights that benefit both the school and our partners in education. Together, parents, the school, and the community work hand in hand to align their efforts towards shared goals and desired outcomes, ensuring a supportive environment for our children’s holistic growth and development.

As such, the PSG serves to:

1.      Partner with the school to support school programmes and activities

2.      Encourage parents’ involvement in the school

3.      Conduct training and learning opportunities to develop parenting skills

4.      Facilitate parents’ peer support and engagement

5.      Enhance relationship between parents and child  
  

Parents can visit [NAPS PSG Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ALL.PSG/) page to find out more about PSG activities and involvement with the school.
