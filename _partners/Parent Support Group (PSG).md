Our Parents Support Group (PSG) was formed in 1999 to promote parenting skills and enable active parents’ involvement in the school programmes and activities.

The PSG believes that a strong partnership between parents and School is essential to fostering our students' success. Built on trust and shared responsibilities, this collaboration offers valuable insights that benefit both the school and our partners in education. Together, parents, the School, and the community work hand in hand to align on shared goals and desired outcomes, ensuring a supportive environment for our children’s holistic growth and development.

As such, the PSG serves to

1.      Partner with School to support school programmes and activities

2.      Encourage parents’ involvement in the School

3.      Conduct training and learning opportunities to develop parenting skills

4.      Facilitate parents’ peer support, engagement

5.      Enhance relationship between parents and child
