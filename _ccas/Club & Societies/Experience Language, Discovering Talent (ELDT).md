EL.DT. stands for Experience Language, Discover Talent. The focus of the CCA will be to nurture students' love for EL and stretch their potential in oratorical skills. In this CCA, students will be exposed to drama, debates and public speaking. Students will be given platforms within and outside school to transfer their learning and showcase their talents. Through this experiential learning, we hope to nurture students to be Confident Persons and Self-directed learners through the development of 21st Century Competencies.
