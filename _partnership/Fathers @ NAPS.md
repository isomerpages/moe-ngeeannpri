Fathers@NAPS &nbsp;was formed in 2009 as a platform to inspire and involve fathers of NAPS pupils to play &nbsp;a more active role in their children's lives. In line with the FDs For Life movement supported by the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports&nbsp;(MCYS), we want fathers to be life long positive influencers on their children by&nbsp;**ACT**:

  

**A**&nbsp;\- Be Aware of the importance of fathers' roles

**C**&nbsp;\- &nbsp;Commit to be good fathers and role models to their children

**T**&nbsp;- Spend Time, Acquire Tools, bring Transformation to lives.
