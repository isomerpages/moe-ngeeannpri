Fathers@NAPS  was formed in 2009 as a platform to inspire and involve fathers of NAPS pupils to play  a more active role in their children's lives. In line with the FDs For Life movement supported by the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS), we want fathers to be life long positive influencers on their children by **ACT**:

  

**A** \- Be Aware of the importance of fathers' roles

**C** \-  Commit to be good fathers and role models to their children

**T** - Spend Time, Acquire Tools, bring Transformation to lives.
