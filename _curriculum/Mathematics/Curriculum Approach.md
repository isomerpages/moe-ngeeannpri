Mathematical problem solving is central to mathematics learning in the schools. It involves the acquisition and application of mathematics concepts and skills in a wide range of situations, including non-routine, open-ended and real-world problems.

  

The development of mathematical problem solving ability is dependent on five inter-related components, namely, Concepts, Skills, Processes, Attitudes and Metacognition.

  

The schoolâ€™s teaching approaches and programmes are aligned closely to the underlying principles of this Mathematics Framework.
