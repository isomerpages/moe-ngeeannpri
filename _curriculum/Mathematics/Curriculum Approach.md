Mathematical problem solving is central to mathematics learning in the schools. It involves the acquisition and application of mathematics concepts and skills in a wide range of situations, including non-routine, open-ended and real-world problems.

  

The development of mathematical problem solving ability is dependent on five inter-related components, namely, Concepts, Skills, Processes, Attitudes and Metacognition.

  

The school’s teaching approaches and programmes are aligned closely to the underlying principles of this Mathematics Framework.

**Varied Teaching Approaches @ Ngee Ann**

  

**Model Drawing (A Pre-Form of Algebra)**

The use of bar-models is one of the commonly used approaches in teaching problem solving in the school. Through the construction of a pictorial model to represent the known and unknown quantities and their relationships in a problem, students gain better understanding of the problem and are able to apply the appropriate techniques to solve it.

  

**Thinking Routine**

The Polya’s Problem Solving Techniques is another approach used to help pupils develop thinking routine when solving problem sums. This technique comprises of the 4 essential steps of understanding the problem, devising a plan on which heuristics skills to use, carrying out the plan and checking the results.
