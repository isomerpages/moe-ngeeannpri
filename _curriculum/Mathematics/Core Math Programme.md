**Core Math Programs @ Ngee Ann**

  

**Performance Task (P1 to P2)**

Performance task is a hands-on activity which uses various concrete objects and measuring instrument to learn a skill or a Mathematical concept. This is an effective teaching approach as younger pupils tend to learn better through play.

  

**Factual Fluency (P1 to P4)**

Factual fluency is development of pupils’ ability to recall basic math facts automatically without hesitation. As Factual Fluency is one of the key component in an ICAN lesson, it was introduced to all classes in P1 to P4. Time was set aside during Math lessons to practise basic number facts to develop factual fluency in pupils. This is to help ease pupils’ cognitive load when learning new concepts.

  

Teachers uses different forms such as flash cards, singing of songs, speed test and games during Math lessons to allow pupils to practice Factual Fluency with their classmates in a fun and interesting way.

  

**Heuristics Skills (Process Skills) in Problem Solving (P2 to P6)**

Various heuristics skills are introduced systematically at each level to help pupils develop competency in their thinking skills through meaningful and challenging tasks. Coupled with Polya’s 4-step Problem Solving Techniques, these tasks develop a set of good habits of mind to help pupils improve on their reasoning and make good connections between various Mathematical concepts.

  

  

**Learning Experiences**

Besides learning concepts and skills, developing pupils’ cognitive and metacognitive skills are equally important. These skills can learned through carefully constructed learning experiences. These learning experiences provie pupils with opportunity to work together, encourages them to be inquisitive and discover mathematical results on their own.
