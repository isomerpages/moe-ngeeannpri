**Support Math Programs @ Ngee Ann**

**Structured Approach in Remediation**

  

**P1 & P2 Learning Support for Mathematics (P1/P2 LSM)**

Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) is an early intervention effort that is aimed to provide additional support to pupils who do not have foundational numeracy skills and knowledge to cope with the Primary 1 and Primary 2 Math curriculum. Pupils were identified for this program through a screening process carried out at the beginning of Primary 1.

  

**ICAN Programme (P3 & P4)**

Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN) programme is a collaboration between schools and MOE to support and raise the confidence and achievement level of low progress learners. Teachers uses intervention strategies in ICAN classes to help pupils close learning gaps by building routines, use available resources to diagnose and intervene appropriately.

  

**P1 to P5 Remediation Programme**

It is important for pupils to have a strong mastery of the basic concepts and skills in important topics like Whole Numbers and Fractions. These basic skills are essential in problem solving. Pupils will be identified based on the exam and topical test results. Pupils will be given diagnostic questions to identify their areas of weakness. Structured worksheets and Math manipulatives will be used to enhance pupilsâ€™ learning of Mathematical concepts and skills.

**P5 & P6 Math Olympiad**

The Olympiad programme aims to identify talented pupils in Mathematics and stretch their problem solving abilities to their fullest potential. Pupils go through a series of structured training sessions before participating in Math competitions like the Singapore Math Olympiad for Primary Schools (SMOPS) and National Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore (NMOS). Pupils who does extremely well in these competitions will be selected by the these judging panels of these competitions and given the opportunity to compete with pupils in an international platform.
