**Structured Approach in Remediation**

  
**P1 to P3 Learning Support for Mathematics (P1 to P3 LSM)**

Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) is an early intervention effort that is aimed to provide additional support to students who do not have foundational numeracy skills and knowledge to cope with the Math curriculum. Students were identified for this program through a screening process carried out at the beginning of Primary 1.

**P4 to P5 Remediation Programme**

It is important for students to have a strong mastery of the basic concepts and skills in important topics like Whole Numbers and Fractions. These basic skills are essential in problem solving. Students will be identified based on the exam and topical test results. Students will be given diagnostic questions to identify their areas of weakness. Structured worksheets and Math manipulatives will be used to enhance students’ learning of Mathematical concepts and skills.

**Special Math Programme @ Ngee Ann**  

**E2K Mathematics**  

The E2K Mathematics Programme is a mathematics enrichment programme offered to students who demonstrates strong aptitude and interest towards Mathematics. It aims to develop in students Mathematical reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach. Students will have opportunities to collaborate with their peers and engage in Mathematical thinking through puzzles, games and Mathematics explorations. The rich learning experiences offered by the programme serve to help students to develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions as well as to gain important 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.

**P5 & P6 Math Olympiad**

The Olympiad programme aims to stretch students in their problem-solving abilities to their fullest potential. Students go through a series of structured training sessions before participating in Math competitions like the Singapore Math Olympiad for Primary Schools (SMOPS) and National Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore (NMOS). Studentss who does extremely well in these competitions will be selected by the judging panels of these competitions and given the opportunity to compete with other students in an international platform.
