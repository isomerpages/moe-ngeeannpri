The Inquiry Approach is the key model for the learning of concepts, skills and exploration of topics in the SS primary syllabus. Our students are **encouraged to be inquisitive** and be motivated to inquire into things that catch their attention. They will be guided to make reasonable judgments that are supported by sound information or based on opinions. Through the inquiry process, our students will be **empowered to be self-directed learners**.
