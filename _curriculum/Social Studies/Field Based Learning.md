Field-based learning allows our students to **contextualise their learning experience in a real-world setting**. They will adopt the inquiry approach as they explore the learning environment and conduct hands-on exploration in a focused area of study, thus **activating their multiple senses** as they are learning. Field-based learning would also **motivate and sustain our students’ interest in the subject** as they would learn to explore, construct new knowledge and make connections to the topic being studied.

  

Field-based learning is incorporated in the learning journey packages, which are carefully designed and crafted to meet the learning dynamics for our students.
