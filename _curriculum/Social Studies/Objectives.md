At the end of a full course of Social Studies (SS) education, the curriculum aspires to **prepare our students to be citizens of tomorrow** by helping them to understand the interconnectedness in Singapore and the world they live in. Our students will be encouraged to inquire real-world issues that concern their lives. This is to help them attain relevant knowledge and understandings of these issues, **develop critical and reflective thinking skills**, and **appreciate different perspectives**. SS seeks to **inculcate in students the values that define the Singaporean society** and **nurture dispositions to show concern for the world they live in** and **demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others**.
