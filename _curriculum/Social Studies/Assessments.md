We gather feedback on our students' learning through a variety of both formal and non-formal modes of assessment. Formal assessment includes worksheets and/or exercises from activity books and other written assignments while non-formal assessment encompasses learning journeys around Singapore, reflection, Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW), gallery walk and other relevant activities. Students also engage in various classroom activities during SS lessons to encourage expression such as debate and role-play.
