<p><strong>Aim</strong>
<br>The aim of the Cyber Wellness programme is to develop every Ngee Ann student
into discerning and responsible ICT users who are able to protect themselves
and be responsible for their well-being in the cyber world.</p>
<p>The school adopts MOE’s Cyber Wellness Framework in educating our students
on Cyber Wellness. This framework focuses on three key processes; Sense,
Think and Act.</p>

<p><em>MOE's Cyber Wellness Framework</em>
</p>
<p>In order for the students to ‘sense’ and ‘think’, they are provided opportunities
to analyze, evaluate and reflect on Cyber Wellness issues. Different platforms
are provided to allow students to translate their understanding into actions
that will keep them safe while being online. These platforms aim to let
students take on the role as advocates to share the messages of Cyber Wellness
with their peers, family and public.</p>
