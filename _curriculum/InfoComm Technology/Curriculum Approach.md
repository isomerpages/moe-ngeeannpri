The ICT department will also promote the inculcation of 21st Century skills of thinking, communication, collaboration and management through its programmes. This will ensure that all Ngee Ann Primary pupils will embody the four domains of these skills and be confident, self-directed learners committed to life-long learning, concerned citizens and active contributors.

In addition to Cyber wellness lessons, pupil leaders, Cyber Champs also share with the whole school in several Cyber wellness topics like ‘Internet Safety’.
