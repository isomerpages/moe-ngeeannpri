At Ngee Ann Primary, the key programmes for pupils not only include the attainment of base-line ICT standards; they also include the promotion of learning through ICT using fun and interactive ways.

The ICT department will also promote the inculcation of 21st Century skills of thinking, communication, collaborationÂ and management through its programmes. This will ensure that all Ngee Ann Primary pupils will embody the four domains of these skills and be confident, self-directed learners committed to life-long learning, concerned citizens and active contributors.
