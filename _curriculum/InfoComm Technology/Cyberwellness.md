In order for the students to ‘sense’ and ‘think’, they are provided opportunities to analyze, evaluate and reflect on Cyber Wellness issues. Different platforms are provided to allow students to translate their understanding into actions that will keep them safe while being online. These platforms aim to let students take on the role as advocates to share the messages of Cyber Wellness with their peers, family and public.
