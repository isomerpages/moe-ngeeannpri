**Ngee Ann Primary School Holistic Education Experience**

Introduction – The Ngee Ann Holistic Education Experience

The holistic education offered at Ngee Ann Primary School (NAPS) is built upon the strong foundation laid down by the founding fathers of the Ngee Ann Kongsi. In keeping with their aim of nurturing resilient children, the school’s mission is to nurture every child to his best.

Every NAPS student will go through a holistic education experience in three phases - ‘Experience’, ‘Explore’ and ‘Expand’. This approach focuses on nurturing cognitive, moral, social, physical, and aesthetic potentials, while promoting student engagement and fostering personal and collective responsibility.

Our holistic education program aims to develop core competencies, values, and character in our students, preparing them to thrive in the 21st century. We are committed to forging strong partnerships with stakeholders to create a positive and enriching learning environment at NAPS.

**1\. Primary 1 and 2: Experience**

In the Experience Phase, NAPS focuses on laying a strong foundation in literacy and numeracy. The curriculum emphasizes the learning of English Language, Mother Tongue Languages and Mathematics to develop communication and problem-solving skills. Additionally, students experience different areas of study in art, music, and sports, so as to discover their interests and talents.

Of equal importance is the emphasis of inculcating values and 21st Century Competencies in our students. Through school programs, they learn and practice values like respectfulness and integrity. The Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) allows for quality teacher-pupil interactions and supports the transition from kindergarten to primary school. Teachers guide students to demonstrate positive traits and collaborate effectively.

In the Programme for Active Learning (PAL), besides modular activities in aesthetics, outdoor education, sports and games, an additional module, Life Skills, was introduced in 2018. Students are taught life skills such as how to pack their bags, tie their shoelaces, and fold their own clothes, fostering personal responsibility as well as to learn to help out at home. Students get to showcase their learning through VIA activities like “I'm a Happy Helper”, volunteering for chores at home.

Furthermore, NAPS provides diverse leadership opportunities for students, starting from Primary 1, to practice leadership skills and take on roles in class as group leaders or subject representatives. The Form Teachers support our young leaders closely and nurture them to fulfil their roles confidently.

**2\. Primary 3 and 4: Explore**

In this phase, concepts and skills learnt are reinforced as students undergo new learning experiences and strengthen their foundation. Teachers encourage students to create, explore and think critically by asking questions to test their concepts learnt previously.

The Extensive Reading (ER) programme for Primary 1-3 students seeks to foster a love for reading which serves as a gateway to a world of imagination and knowledge. ER lessons encourage pupils to explore a wide range of books, to cultivate curiosity and expand their understanding of the world. Besides enhancing their vocabulary and comprehension, students also develop critical thinking skills. ER also infuses teaching of social skills, empowering young readers to engage with texts on a personal level and to articulate their thoughts with confidence.

The NAPS P3 Mathematics Learning Experiences@Home (LE@Home) package was piloted in 2023 to enhance students’ understanding of key mathematical concepts, while leveraging on home-school partnerships. Students were provided with concrete manipulatives to conduct experiential learning activities at home over the school holidays.

In our effort to develop interests and discover talents at Ngee Ann Primary, we provide a plethora of experiences under the school’s LLP, “GRowing Appreciation for Creative Expression” (GRACE). Our middle primary students can expect to dabble with instruments of different cultures and even tap on the affordances of our digital environment to compose music and create art.

Teacher-student relationships continued to be strengthened through cohort FTGP activities like birthday celebrations, level bonding activities, acknowledgment of students’ desired behaviours, as well as academic and CCA achievements. These initiatives motivate pupils to give their best in their academic and non-academic pursuits.

As part of the school’s ALP – Sustainable Green@NAPS (SG@NAPS), the P3 students collect food waste to be converted into compost for plant fertilizer. They also participate in the Clean Plate Campaign, an initiative started by Food from The Heart. Through these activities, students learn how they can do their part in sustainability efforts and contribute back to the community. 

A platter of Leadership opportunities are offered to our middle primary students.  The P4-P1 Buddy Programme is a platform that allows all P4 students to take on a leadership role by guiding and helping the newcomers to adjust to the new physical environment. Through the interactions, students develop reciprocal care and respect amongst themselves.

Students can also be nominated to serve as Class Monitors, PE Monitors, AV Leaders, Cyberchamps and Peer Support Leaders. Selected Primary 3 students are also nominated by Form Teachers to serve as Prefects. They undergo rigorous training and mentoring by their Primary 4 to 6 seniors so that they can fulfill their responsibilities within the school and the larger community. At Primary 4, students with the right attitude and dispositions will also have the chance to serve as CCA Leaders

To enable our students to be caring and confident leaders, student leaders undergo the Caring and Competent Leaders (C2L) training sessions. Held once a semester, the sessions introduce leadership concepts and emphasize the importance of teamwork, based on Kouzes and Pozner's Leadership practices.

**3. Primary 5 and 6: Expand**

A rich array of learning experiences that cater not only to the cognitive aspects, but also the physical, aesthetic, social and moral domains are provided for upper primary students in this phase. Our students further develop their interests and talents in music, art and sports via the GRACE LLP and CCAs. 

Through ALP – SG@NAPS, students get to deepen their understanding of sustainability and apply their knowledge to address real-life challenges. Under the key pillar of Sustainable Living, students are actively involved in Project Zero Waste which helps to promote A Green Citizenry that consumes and wastes less and strengthens eco-friendly efforts within the school. The Sustainable Living Week is a key event to celebrate their sustainability learning milestones through interactive and engaging activities.

In character development, the school organises various VIA programmes to enable students to contribute to the neighbouring communities. Students are also given the opportunity to role-model school values to their juniors as they spearhead VIA projects. The P5 students will take part in Walk for Rice to contribute to efforts to help the needy families in the communities.  P6 students are tasked to organise a games carnival for their juniors as well as to reach out to the elderly in our community from Goodlife! Makan and St Luke’s Eldercare. 

To provide our students with a global perspective, the school organises overseas learning trips and school immersion programmes with schools in Penang and Suzhou. Through these experiential learning opportunities and networking with students from other countries, we hope to deepen pupil’s appreciation of different cultures and embrace diversity.

Our upper primary student leaders get to deepen their leadership competencies through working in groups to plan and implement service projects for the school and/or external community. Some students are appointed as Eco Champs to champion eco efforts while others serve as mentors to their juniors.

In this phase, teachers often take on the role of facilitators to guide and nurture our pupils. Activities like Level Bonding Games and Chillax Sessions with Principal and form teachers allow teachers to interact with pupils to better understand their needs and to motivate them. Awards are given to pupils to recognise them for their improvement in academic and non-academic areas. The P5 camp and the P6 ‘Camparaderie’ provide the platforms for pupils to strengthen the rapport between teachers and pupils while acquiring life skills.
