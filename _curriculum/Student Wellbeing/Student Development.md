The goal of the Student Development Team (SDT) is to promote the holistic development and overall well-being of students through the provision of age-appropriate learning experiences and to nurture a culture of care and belonging to the school. In Ngee Ann Primary, we believe every child matters, and every child should have the opportunity to progress at their own pace so as to enhance their self-efficacy. We seek to promote student agency through our school-based curriculum and to develop in our students a sense of belonging to the school. 

<u>Peer Support Relationship</u>
<br>
Positive peer relationships facilitate the provision of care, building of resilience and a sense of belonging amongst students. In Ngee Ann Primary School, Peer Support Relationship (PSR) follows the framework from MOE.
