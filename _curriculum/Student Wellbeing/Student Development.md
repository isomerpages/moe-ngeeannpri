The goal of the Student Development Team (SDT) is to promote the holistic development and overall well-being of students through the provision of age-appropriate learning experiences and to nurture a culture of care and belonging to the school. In Ngee Ann Primary, we believe every child matters, and every child should have the opportunity to progress at their own pace so as to enhance their self-efficacy. We seek to promote student agency through our school-based curriculum and to develop in our students a sense of belonging to the school. 

<u>Peer Support Relationship</u>
<br>
Positive peer relationships facilitate the provision of care, building of resilience and a sense of belonging amongst students. In Ngee Ann Primary School, Peer Support Relationship (PSR) follows the framework from MOE.

In Ngee Ann Primary School, students are encouraged to provide social and emotional support to one another and facilitate help-seeking by alerting trusted school personnel when their friends encounter difficulties. Supportive peer relationships can contribute to and strengthen a caring school culture.  To equip all students to be a peer supporter, the “CHEER” model, adapted from MOE Guidance Branch, is introduced as part of the Peer Support Curriculum. Peer Support Skills are taught in both curricular contexts and experiential learning through the various school activities, programmes and events.

Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) are appointed and trained to provide timely support to students within the class and level. The PSLs go through training sessions to equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge in carrying out their duties.

To promote the culture of positive peer relationship and to provide a platform for the Peer Support Leaders to showcase and apply what they have learnt, a B.F.F (Be a Fabulous Friend) week is organized annually.  The PSLs take the lead to coordinate and manage the photo and games booths.  The aim is to remind students on the importance of being a good friend and foster positive peer relationships through games and activities during recess.
