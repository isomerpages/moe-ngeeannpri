<u>Discipline</u><br>
Students learn when there is order and discipline.  The goal of the Student Management team is to instil self-discipline and good characters in students. The school corrects students’ behaviour and discipline students with care as we believe that discipline is a learning process to develop students’ thinking and moral faculties. The school adopts a multi-façade approach for developing good discipline in students. One of the key strategies for developing good discipline is to build on students’ social and emotional competencies.  Skills are explicitly taught and mindsets are cultivated to reinforce students’ self-discipline and positive behaviour.

<u>SEN Support </u><br>
In the provision of support for students with Special Education Needs (SEN), students suspected with learning needs and flagged for referral will receive support from the Special Education Needs Officers (SENOs)

Students with official diagnosis of SEN and those with observed traits are assigned to Form Teachers who are trained in Special Needs or have experiences managing students with SEN. These students are also monitored closely by the SENOs.

Students with autism have an Individualized Education Plan crafted in line with the Structured TEACCH Approach for students with autism. For students with dyslexia, they are supported with the resources and structure based on the Orton-Gillingham Approach that is similar to the Dyslexia Association of Singapore (DAS) Literacy Support that incorporates a structured, engaging and multi-sensory learning.

Social Skills @ Recess Programme started in 2021.  This programme focuses on turn-taking, friendship skills, conversation manners and observing social norms for students with SEN. The SENOs also conduct “Walk in The Shoes of Others” to promote inclusivity for students with SEN in their mainstream classes.  The aim is to create awareness among the students that their peers may differ and highlight the need to practise empathy and patience to form a community of support.

<u>TRANSIT Programme</u>
<br>
Ngee Ann Primary School has been identified to be part of the MOE’s pilot programme for **TRANsition Support for InTegration (TRANSIT)**.  The programme takes place during Primary 1 to help students with social and behavioural needs develop independence through learning foundational self-management skills. Students are identified for this support programme based on information gathered from parents and teachers, and through systematic observations conducted by trained school personnel. The students identified for TRANSIT are taught pre-requisite skills in pull-out classes and are gradually integrated back into their form classes.

<u>School Counsellor and Teacher Counsellors</u><br>
The School Counsellor supported by trained Teacher Counsellors provide support to students to manage and cope with social-emotional challenges and empower them for success. The School Counsellor and Teacher Counsellors meet up with the students weekly or fortnightly for counselling sessions to help them cope and manage the challenges they face.
