In line with Singapore Green Plan 2030 and schools’ eco-stewardship programme, Ngee Ann Primary has developed our sustainability education that focuses on enabling students to explore environmental issues, be engaged in problem-solving, develop values and attitudes and make a commitment to take action to improve the environment.

Aligned with 21st Century competencies, we nurture eco-stewards by integrating sustainability

trends into the science curriculum.

Sustainable Food Waste Management, “From Waste to Gold”
-------------------------------------------------------

P3 students learn the importance of food wastage and how to manage it. They learn how food wastage can be turned into ‘gold’ i.e. compost and used as fertilisers for plants. Students will conduct investigation aligned with the science syllabus on the life cycle of plants.

Sustainable Material Management, “From Trash to Treasure”
---------------------------------------------------------

P4 students learn about the 3Rs and how to upcycle the materials to make useful products.

By using design thinking framework, the students will collaborate together to design a solution for a given problem.

Sustainable Energy Management, “Power of Nature”
------------------------------------------------

P5 students learn about the importance of energy conservation, clean energy and alternative sources of energy. Through hands-on investigations, students will understand more about how they can play a part in energy conservation. Students will have hands-on experience in using Micro:bits while creating a sustainable solution to combat environmental issues.

To cultivate a green citizenzry, we equip students to become responsible advocates of the environment. We design and provide learning experiences to help students understand real-world issues and how the individual could positively contribute to sustainable development.

| Level | Learning Experience | Objective |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
|P4 to 6|Project Zero Waste, Paper Recycling| Students are active participants to collect recycled papers in their classrooms. Eco representatives from each class are given leadership opportunities to take the lead|
|P5-6|Eco Club|Eco Club members are the school’s eco champions who are passionate in leading the school in their environmental efforts. The students participate in environmental workshops and competitions. They are also given opportunities to engage the school to bring about greater awareness on environmental issues during the annual Sustainable Living Week through assembly talks and setting up booths. Students also take part in the completion of the Young Scientist Card on Sustainability.
