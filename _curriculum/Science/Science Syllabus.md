The Science syllabus in Ngee Ann Primary School follows closely to the Primary Science Syllabus as designed by MOE (2023 syllabus for Primary 3; 2014 syllabus for Primary 4, 5 and 6) in helping our students understand and address many of the local and global challenges they will face in the 21stÂ century.

To navigate these challenges, we need to develop scientifically literate citizens who:

*   Can make informed decisions and responsible actions in their daily lives,
*   Participate in socio-scientific issues ethically and in an informed manner and
*   Apply scientific knowledge and skills, as well as adopt scientific attitudes and mindsets to innovate and push new frontiers.

These are the skills and habits of mind that are aligned to the desired 21st century competencies.
