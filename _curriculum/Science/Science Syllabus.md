The Science syllabus in Ngee Ann Primary School follows closely to the Primary Science Syllabus as designed by MOE and emphasises the need for a balance between the acquisition of science knowledge, process and attitudes. This includes the development of reasoning and analytical skills, decision and problem solving skills, the ability to respond to different contexts and an open and inquiring mind that is willing to explore new territories and learn new things. These are the skills and habits of mind that are aligned to the desired 21st century competencies.
