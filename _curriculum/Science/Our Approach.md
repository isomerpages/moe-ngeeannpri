Science teaching and learning in Ngee Ann Primary School is based on the inquiry-based approach in which students are engaged in meaningful activities and processes to develop fundamental science concepts, principles and theories, as well as science process skills and attitudes. Students learn through hands-on experimentation, collaborative learning and self-exploration. Learning stations and outdoor learning have been included in the Science curriculum to enthuse, engage, empower and enrich student learning in the school.

Through active learning, students acquire the skills to synthesize knowledge, transfer their learning in varied contexts and make connections with their surroundings.
