| “Each Child a Seed” Programme     | P3     | Every Child a Seed is one of the programmes organised by NParks to involve school students in appreciating greenery. The programme gives every P3 student a chance to grow their own plant, go through and appreciate the challenges of the planting process, and experience the joy of seeing their plants grow.<br><br>Complementing the Primary 3 Science syllabus, this programme will also teach students about the life cycle of a plant, plant parts and their functions. The values of care and responsibility will also be reinforced.<br><br>Through this programme, we hope that students will appreciate the effort needed to care for plants and understand that every Singaporean plays a part in shaping our City in a Garden.     |
|Plants Exploratory Experience at Our Ngee Ann Garden|P3 and P4|Students will be able to visit the school garden to observe and explore plants and plant parts. The observations will support students to deepen their understanding of scientific concepts related to plants.<br><br>Tapping on the affordances of ICT tools such as Google sites, students take ownership of their own learning by gathering of and understanding information about plants. Students learn from one another as they discuss and share what they have observed in class.| 
|Science Practical Assessments|P3 and P4|Beyond written assessments, practical assessments will be conducted to provide opportunities for students to demonstrate their learning and application of scientific skills and processes such as Observing, Classifying and Comparing.|
|Self-directed Exploratory Learning|P3 to P6|Students are provided with learning experiences through observing life cycles of plants and animals, self-directed explorations, and/or conducting performance tasks.<br><br>Students learn by doing and reflect on their learning to develop scientific knowledge, skills and attitudes. They also collaborate and communicate their scientific ideas with one another. At the end of the tasks, students take ownership of their own learning when they reflect on their learning experiences.|
|Hands-on Learning Stations|P3 to P6|The learning stations across the different themes in the lower block (P3 and P4) and the upper block (P5 and P6) allow students to acquire knowledge and understanding of their natural and physical world based on investigations, apply the skills and processes of inquiry and develop attitudes and values that are essential to the practice of science.
|Learning Journey|P6|Through the learning journey, students interact with their surroundings to observe and explore living organisms or science processes up close. This allows students to strengthen the learning of scientific concepts and enriches their experiences beyond the classroom to make learning meaningful and authentic. ICT tools are also incorporated for mobile learning and on-site collaboration among students.
