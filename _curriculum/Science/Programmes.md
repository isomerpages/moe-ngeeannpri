| “Each Child a Seed” Programme     | P3     | Every Child a Seed is one of the programmes organised by NParks to involve school students in appreciating greenery. The programme gives every P3 student a chance to grow their own plant, go through and appreciate the challenges of the planting process, and experience the joy of seeing their plants grow.<br><br>Complementing the Primary 3 Science syllabus, this programme will also teach students about the life cycle of a plant, plant parts and their functions. The values of care and responsibility will also be reinforced.<br><br>Through this programme, we hope that students will appreciate the effort needed to care for plants and understand that every Singaporean plays a part in shaping our City in a Garden.     |
