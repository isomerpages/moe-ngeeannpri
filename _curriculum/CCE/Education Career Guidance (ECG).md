**P5 Career Talk**

  

The career talk is conducted for all Primary 5 pupils at the end of the year as part of the post-exam activities. It is aimed to promote awareness of the different careers to allow our pupils to have a better understanding of the academic prerequisites/ pathways for each of the career and job expectations. Through this talk, we hope that our pupils get to meet outside specialists to share about their areas of work and experience in educational and career planning.
