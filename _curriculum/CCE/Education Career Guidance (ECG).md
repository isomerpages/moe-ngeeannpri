**P5 Career Talk**

  

The career talk is conducted for all Primary 5 pupils at the end of the year as part of the post-exam activities. It is aimed to promote awareness of the different careers to allow our pupils to have a better understanding of the academic prerequisites/ pathways for each of the career and job expectations. Through this talk, we hope that our pupils get to meet outside specialists to share about their areas of work and experience in educational and career planning.

**P6 Secondary School Talks**

  

As part of the post PSLE activities, all Primary 6 pupils attend talks held in Ngee Ann Primary School by Secondary school representatives. Through these sessions, pupils can find out more on the holistic curriculum offered by each secondary school and also learn about secondary school life. At the end of the session, they can also interact with students of the secondary schools to find out its school culture as well as ask questions to clarify their doubts.
