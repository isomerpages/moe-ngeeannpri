Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work, and hence to manage their career pathways and lifelong learning throughout their lives. Through ECG, social emotional competencies and qualities of proactivity, adaptability and resilience are developed to prepare students for the 21st Century. 

Career talks are conducted for Primary 5 students to promote awareness of the different careers and help them have a better understanding of the academic prerequisites/ pathways for each of the career and job expectations. Through this talk, our students can meet professionals who share about their areas of work and experience in educational and career planning. 

The MySkillsFuture portal for students is a one-stop ECG portal that empowers our Primary 5 and Primary 6 students to embark on a journey of self-discovery and make informed education and career choices. Students may use the information and tools to explore various education and career pathways and take charge of their future. Students are given opportunities to explore their educational and career interests via [MySkillsFuture](https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/student/en/preu/about/myskillsfuture-for-students.html) portal during Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) lessons.

**P6 Secondary School Talks**

As part of the post PSLE activities, all Primary 6 students attend talks held in Ngee Ann Primary School by Secondary School representatives. Through these sessions, students can find out more on the holistic curriculum offered by each secondary school and also learn about secondary school life. At the end of the session, they can also interact with students of the secondary schools to find out its school culture as well as ask questions to clarify their doubts.
