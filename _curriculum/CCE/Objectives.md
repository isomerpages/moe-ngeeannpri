The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum emphasizes the inculcation of core values, social and emotional competencies and civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills that are critical for students' character and citizenship development, to better prepare our students to thrive in a fast-changing and highly-connected world. The various key programmes such as Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons, Values-in-action (VIA), Social Studies (SS), Co-curricular Activities (CCA). Learning Journeys (LJs), P1 and P2 Programme for Active Learning (PAL) and Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) are in place to inculcate values and build competencies in our students.

  

Values and competencies are explicitly taught during character and citizenship education lessons and infused throughout the curriculum as well as through reflection and experience. Service to the school and community, leadership roles and responsibilities, CCAs and project work are various platforms and opportunities for students to apply what they have internalised and learnt. In the process of contributing their time, resources and working with one another, students can live out the school values and shine in the community.

**P1 to P6 Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)**

**We aim to:**

\- Inculcate values and build competencies in our pupils to develop them to be good individuals and useful citizens.

  

**Curriculum:**

The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum was launched on 2 January 2014 by Education Minister Heng Swee Keat. New textbooks and instructional materials for Primary 1 and 2 have been implemented. A key feature of these textbooks is 'family time', which suggests activities for parents to bond with their children.

  

**Medium of Instruction:**

CCE lessons are conducted in the official Mother Tongue Languages (MTL). For pupils who offer the Non-Tamil Indian Languages (NTIL), namely, Bengali, Punjabi and Urdu as their Mother Tongue and for those who are exempted from taking MTL, CCE will be taught in English.

  

**Features of the CCE Syllabus:**

Pupils will learn values through three overarching ideas, namely (Identity, Relationships and Choices in six domains, starting with self and extending to the family, school, community, nation and the world. The diagram below shows the Core Values, the 3 Big Ideas and the Expanding Domains in the CCE syllabus:

The 3 Big Ideas, Identity, Relationships and Choices, are core concepts of the syllabus. They are interconnected and impact one another. Pupils need to know who they are in order to relate positively with others. Relationships they forge shape their identity and influence the choices they make. The ability to make good choices impacts on their understanding of their own identity and the relationships they form.

  

  

**Approach:**

Drawn from the Constructivist Theory which posits that each learner individually (and socially) constructs knowledge as he/she learns, the CCE pedagogy is process-based and focuses on the “why” and “how”. The aim is to facilitate the learning of skills and internalisation of values through action and reflection as learners learn best when they are actively engaged. The teaching approaches are as below:

  

*   Story Telling Approach

*   Consideration Approach

*   Cognitive Development Approach

*   Experiential Learning Approach

*   Modified Values Clarification Approach

  

Apart from the formal teaching of CCE, school-wide programmes provide pupils with opportunities for experiential learning so that they are able to internalise the values taught and translate them into action. Below are the programmes and activities that contribute to the whole-school approach in values education:

  

*   Values-in-action (VIA)

*   National Education (NE)

*   Co-curriculum Activity (CCA)

*   Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)

*   Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)

*   Programme for Active Learning (PAL)
