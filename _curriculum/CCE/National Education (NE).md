**NE Commemorative Events**

Every year, our school commemorates the 4 core NE events which have been identified as defining moments in Singapore's history. The aim is to entrench these events and the images they evoke in the consciousness of each successive generation.

**Total Defence Day**

On 15 February 1942, the British surrendered to the Japanese. Total Defence Day is commemorated on 15 February annually, to remind our pupils that Singapore is defensible and is worth defending, and we ourselves must defend Singapore. Pupils learn what the five aspects of Total Defence are and how they can play a part in each aspect.

**International Friendship Day**

International Friendship Day is commemorated on the 3rd Friday of Term 2. It is a good opportunity to help our pupils learn about and appreciate the diverse and colourful culture and traditions of the region, and the lives of peers in the other ASEAN countries, also nurture in our pupils the spirit of friendship and collaboration among different peoples.

**Racial Harmony Day**

Racial Harmony Day is commemorated on 21 July. On this day in 1964, Singapore saw racial riots. Racial Harmony Day serves to remind our pupils that social division costs us dearly and that race and religion are potential fault-lines in Singapore society. It is also a day for pupils to reflect on, and celebrate Singapore’s success as a harmonious nation and society built on a rich diversity of cultures and heritages. Pupils will learn that in Singapore, people are treated equally regardless of their race and religion. They will learn to make friends with people of other races and religions, and appreciate the different cultures that make up Singapore.

National Day is celebrated every year on 9 August to commemorate Singapore’s independence from Malaysia 1965. National Day marks our Separation from Malaysia, and our emergence as an independent country in the community of nations. The National Day Celebration in school aims to bring to the pupils a greater awareness of the historical importance and solemnity of National Day.
