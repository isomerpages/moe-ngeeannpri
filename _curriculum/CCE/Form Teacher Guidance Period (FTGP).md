In line with the Primary Education Review and Implementation (PERI) recommendations, the school embarked on the Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) from Primary 1 to 6. FTGP is conducted once a week within the school’s curriculum time for all classes by the form teachers.

Research has shown that students are more likely to be emotionally and intellectually invested in classes where they have positive relationships with their teachers (Nichols, 2006; Pianta, 1999; Phelan, 1992). Social emotional competencies are critical to the development of students. Explicit instructions for social emotional competencies will assist them to acquire life skills that will benefit them for life. The provision of opportunities for social and emotional learning (SEL) contributes to the formation of good teacher-student relationship (Jennings & Greenberg, 2009; Murray, 2002; Pianta, 1999).

As such, weekly FTGP lessons with purposeful teacher-student interactions and the explicit teaching of social and emotional competencies are planned. This is to provide the platform for teachers and students to establish a good rapport and allow teachers to identify the needs of students so that they can provide them with better support.

During FTGP, the following takes place:-

· Explicit teaching of social and emotional competencies (including Youth issues such as Cyberwellness; and Education and Career Guidance).

· Team-building games and birthday celebrations to enhance bonding amongst students.

· Teacher-Student Conferencing (TSC) to foster better teacher relationship with their students through one-to-one interaction.

· Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons for upper primary (Primary 5 & 6). This compulsory CCE Guidance module, delivered through the Growing Years series, has specific objectives and content. It addresses issues associated with child and adolescent development.

The FTGP is also designed with activities for students to acquire skills that will help them to:

· better understand themselves (Self-Awareness);

· learn ways to manage themselves (Self-Management);

· better understand their family and friends (Social Awareness);

· learn ways to work with their family and friends (Relationship Management)

· make appropriate and responsible decisions (Responsible Decision Making)
