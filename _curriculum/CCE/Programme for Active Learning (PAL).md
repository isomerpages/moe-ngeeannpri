**P1 and P2 Programme for Active Learning (PAL)**

  

PAL seeks to nurture the whole child and broaden the primary school foundation with more emphasis on non-academic programmes for all Primary 1 and 2 pupils. The various activities in the programme aim to develop pupils in the 3Cs: Curiosity, Confidence and Cooperation.

  

There are 4 modules in PAL, namely: Sports & Games, Outdoor Education, Visual Arts and Performing Arts. Three periods are set aside each week where pupils are exposed to broad learning experiences in these 4 modules. PAL is experiential in nature and incorporates learning in a creative, fun and enjoyable way.

  

The packages for the various modules are customised according to the needs and profile of our students. Applying the learner-centred approach to impart social-emotional skills within the context of the four domains, this school-based curriculum provides a wide range of learning experiences for students through a variety of pedagogical strategies such as cooperative learning, inquiry-based learning and reflective learning. Opportunities are also created for students to apply the attitudes, skills and knowledge acquired during the lessons. The school hopes that students will discover their interests and develop their talents through these exposures.

  

Over two years, students will participate in 8 modules conducted by our teachers as illustrated in the table below.
