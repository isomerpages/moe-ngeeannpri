Oversee by the Student Development Team, decentralized assembly programmes are customized to better cater to the learning needs of students in the level. Using this platform, we create opportunities during mass level talks, level bonding activities and birthday celebrations for students to interact with their peers and develop in them the skills, knowledge and dispositions to manage self and relationships effectively. Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) lessons and one-to-one interaction by Form Teachers are planned in alignment with the decentralized assembly programmes to ensure congruence to the teaching of values and social skills.
