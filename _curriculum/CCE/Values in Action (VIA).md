We aim to develop each student to be concerned citizens and active contributors to the society through the structured VIA programmes by levels. VIA provide the learning experiences that support students’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. VIA also encourage students’ ownership of their learning, and how they contribute to the community. VIA activities are differentiated and developmental in nature according to the objectives that have been spelt out for the different levels. VIA provides students with a means for self-development by integrating meaningful community service with instruction and **_reflection_** to enrich the learning experience, teach **_civic responsibility_**, encourage lifelong **_civic engagement_**, and strengthen communities for the common good.

  

Some highlights of our VIA activities include Use-Your-Hands campaign for all students, Happy Helper for Primary 1 and 2, Happy Canteen for Primary 3, Buddy Programme for Primary 4, Keep the Environment Clean for Primary 5 and Project Hope for Primary 6.
