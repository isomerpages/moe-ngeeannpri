VIA provide the learning experiences that support students’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. The experiences encourage students to be actively involved in meaningful activities at home and in school. &nbsp;They develop a sense of responsibility and care for their own and shared spaces through daily cleaning and adopting sustainability practices in school and at home. Time is allocated during Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) for students to plan and implement projects where they can contribute to the class and school, and reflect on what they have learnt.

Some highlights of our VIA activities include Use-Your-Hands campaign for all students, Happy Helper for Primary 1 and 2, Clean Plate Campaign for Primary 3, Buddy Programme for Primary 4, Support Staff Appreciation for Primary 5 and Community Outreach for Primary 6.

Primary 1 &amp; 2 Happy Helper
<br>
The lower primary students were given a task card “I am a Happy Helper”.  The aim of this task was to encourage students to cultivate lifelong good habits and respect by helping out in the household chores for their family. Through this experience, students learned to extend their care for their home and eventually to the wider community. They were encouraged to help out with the household chores at home as well as to keep their class clean and create a conducive classroom environment. Students logged on to SLS to submit a photograph or video of their completed tasks.

P4 Buddy Programme
<br>
The P4-P1 Buddy Programme is implemented as part of our school’s VIA learning experience to provide platforms for students to show care and contribute to the community, and nurture them into socially responsible and concerned citizens. This year, the Primary 4 buddies guided the Primary 1 students during the recesses of the second week of school. They showed them how to buy their meals, brought them around the school and shared their experiences.

P6 Community Outreach
<br>
To show care and compassion, and bring joy to the elderly in our community, the Primary 6 students put together mini-performances for the elderly residents of Goodlife! Makan. They prepared songs and games to interact with the elderly during their lunch, and hand-made coasters for them. The students also prepared care packs for the elderly at St Luke’s Eldercare.

The Primary 6 students also organized a Games Carnival for the rest of the school populace. They put their entrepreneurial skills and creativity into making games from scratch using recycled materials and self-organized the carnival.
