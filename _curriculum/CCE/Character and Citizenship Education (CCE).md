The CCE curriculum emphasizes the inculcation of core values, social and emotional competencies and civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills that are critical for students' character and citizenship development, to better prepare our students to thrive in a fast-changing and highly-connected world. The various key programmes such as Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons, Values-in-action (VIA), Social Studies (SS), Co-curricular Activities (CCA). Learning Journeys (LJs), P1 and P2 Programme for Active Learning (PAL) and Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) are in place to inculcate values and build competencies in our students.

  

Values and competencies are explicitly taught during character and citizenship education lessons and infused throughout the curriculum as well as through reflection and experience. Service to the school and community, leadership roles and responsibilities, CCAs and project work are various platforms and opportunities for students to apply what they have internalised and learnt. In the process of contributing their time, resources and working with one another, students can live out the school values and shine in the community.
