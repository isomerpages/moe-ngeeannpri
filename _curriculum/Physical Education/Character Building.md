In our PE lessons, our pupils are taught values that help them shape their moral character. The PE department has adopted the school values of Integrity, Resilience, Respectfulness and Commitment. The PE curriculum creates opportunities during PE lessons for our pupils to learn and apply these values. This will help our pupils to learn how to be both tenacious and gracious in a sports setting.
