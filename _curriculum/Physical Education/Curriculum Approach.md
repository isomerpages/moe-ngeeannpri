Using the PE curriculum, the PE teachers engage pupils in various sports and games. Rigour is an important aspect of PE lessons as the human body needs physical challenges in order to grow stronger and to achieve a healthier body weight as well as a more alert mind and a more positive outlook on life in general.

  

The various sports, games and fundamental movements taught in the PE lessons serve to promote our pupilsâ€™ competencies in these physical activities. This will help our pupils to find out which areas of sports and games they have an inclination in. Through the exploration and pursuit of these activities, pupils may develop a lifelong interest and participation in physical movement, which will help maintain or increase their fitness well into adulthood.

  

Our pupils are also taught to be aware of how they can move their bodies. With a deeper understanding and appreciation of the complexity of human movements, it will enable our pupils to become more confident and competent in sports and physical activities. With greater confidence in their abilities to move, it will help our pupils to continue to be engaged in lifelong physical activities and in the process, boosting their fitness and self-esteem.
