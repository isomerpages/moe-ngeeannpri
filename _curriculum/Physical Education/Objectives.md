**“Physical Literacy for Life”** 

Physical Literacy is the motivation, confidence, physical competence, knowledge and understanding to value and take responsibility for engagement in physical activities (Whitehead, 2016).

Ngee Ann Primary School's physical education programme provides students with a wide range of movement experiences to develop physical literacy and lay the foundation for an active life.

  

Ngee Ann Primary Physical Education programme aims to develop in each pupil the ability to:

1.  move with competence in a wide variety of physical activities in multiple environments;
2.  demonstrate confidence and positive self-esteem through body awareness and control.
3.  develop and maintain physical health and fitness through active participation in physical activities;
4.  demonstrate resilience, commitment, integrity and respect through sports; and

Through engagement in PE activities, we aim to nurture pupils’ lifelong participation in sports and physical activities
