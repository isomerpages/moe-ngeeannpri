Our design of the English curriculum and programmes has been guided by the 2010 EL syllabus and principles of Holistic Assessment. The school curriculum and STELLAR work hand in hand to prepare our students to be confident users of the language. Taking into consideration the students’ cognitive development and the background knowledge that they bring with them, the curriculum has been designed to stretch the students’ learning while respecting their differences.
