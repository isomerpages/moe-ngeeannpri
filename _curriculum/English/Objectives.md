**The English Language Learning Experience in Ngee Ann**

In Ngee Ann Primary, we believe in empowering the pupils through literacy. In order to nurture our pupils to be independent learners, they must be confident users of the language. Hence, our English programme has been tailored to equip our pupils with the necessary receptive and productive skills and a sound understanding of knowledge about language.
