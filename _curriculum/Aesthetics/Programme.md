The Aesthetics Programme at Ngee Ann Primary School (NAPS) cultivates our pupils' interest in the Arts by creating a vibrant environment that includes several Visual and Performing Arts programmes for pupils to find their strengths in. Pupils will learn a variety of skills to enable them in communicating their thoughts, ideas and feelings effectively through the Arts. As they progress, they are guided to apply their knowledge creatively in different Art forms.
