To reflect their passion for the Visual Arts, our young artists from the school’s Art Club have used their talent to put their best effort into producing the following art pieces, “Anggerik”, “Anyone Hungry?” and “Identities” which were submitted for the SYF Art Exhibition 2023 based on the theme of “Artist and Inspiration”.

We are proud to announce that our students artists behind “Anggerik” have received the _Certificate of Recogition_ for their piece. All three works will be put up on an E-gallery by the SYF committee.

“Our artwork is inspired by the late Mr Sarkasi Said’s artwork entitled Rawa-Rawa.

We decided to do three batik paintings showing orchids. Mounted together, they form a triangular prism. We installed lighting inside the prism to show a glowing lantern effect that adds to the vibrancy of the orchids.”

“Our artwork is inspired by Tan Zi Xi’s Plastic Ocean.

We want to encourage people to stop throwing plastic waste into the ocean. Due to pollution, marine creatures are ingesting plastics. Just imagine that happening to us. Fancy some plastic steamed fish, chilli crab and salted egg yolk prawns?”

“Inspired by Picasso’s Weeping Woman, the background reflects undulating life experiences, while the fingerprints represent how uniquely individuals process emotions. The specks of gold remind us that despite challenges we face, our strengths and talents will shine through in times of difficulty. Positive thoughts and deeds generates possibilities to win.”
