<p><strong><u>SYFAP 2024</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) has long been an annual event organized
by the Arts Education Branch (AEB) under the Ministry of Education, celebrating
the diverse artistic talents of our youth. As part of SYF, the Arts Presentation
(AP) serves as a platform for schools to showcase their performances and
receive constructive feedback from a panel of adjudicators, supporting
ongoing learning and improvement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are proud to announce that the resilience our students demonstrated
throughout months of preparation resulted in vibrant and captivating performances
during the SYF Arts Presentation 2024. Our Chinese Orchestra, Choir, Malay,
and Indian Dance groups were awarded Certificates of Accomplishment, while
our Guzheng and Chinese Dance teams earned Certificates of Distinction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A heartfelt thank you to all students, teachers, and instructors for their
dedication in making this a truly unforgettable experience.</p>
