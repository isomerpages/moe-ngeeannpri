Traditionally, the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) is an annual event organised by the Arts Education Branch (AEB) from the Ministry of Education, to celebrate the diverse artistic talents of our youths. As part of the SYF, the Arts Presentation (AP) is a performance and benchmarking platform for schools to receive feedback and affirmation from a panel of adjudicators for continual learning and improvement.

This year, five of our performing groups, Chinese Orchestra, Gu Zheng, Choir, Chinese Dance, and Malay Dance had taken part in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation.

In view of the impact of Covid-19 on CCAs, the intention of benchmarking was cancelled for the year. Regardless, our passionate performers had started preparing for the festival since last year. We are proud to announce that the tremendous sense of resilience they had shown over the past few months of practices had resulted in beautiful and vibrant performances during the SYFAP 2022.

We would like to thank all students, teachers and instructors for all the effort put into making this a truly memorable experience for the students.
