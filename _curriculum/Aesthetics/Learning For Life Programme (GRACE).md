*“Before a child speaks, it sings. Before they write, they paint. As soon as they stand, they dance. Art is the basis of human expression.”*
 -Phylicia Rashad

GRowing Appreciation for Creative Expression (GRACE) is the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) at Ngee Ann Primary School. GRACE leverages on visual and performing arts to speak to the affective domains of our students and imbibe in them values that will serve as strong moral compass to navigate a future yet unknown. Through GRACE, students develop socio-emotional skills and competencies that will enable them to thrive in their lives ahead.

**GRACE Framework**

GRACE encompasses all visual and performing arts experiences at Ngee Ann Primary School. Currently, it develops students in two tiers: “Students” and “Talents”.

At Ngee Ann Primary School, “Talents” comprises of students who are  passionate to learn the Arts, and also those who have the heart to serve as leaders to champion the Arts.
