<p><strong><u>Arts Fest 2025</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Arts Fest at NAPS: Celebrating Creative Expression</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of the school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in <em>GRowing Appreciation for Creative Expression (GRACE)</em>,
Arts Fest is an annual celebration that allows every student to experience
the vibrancy of the arts while marking the end of a meaningful first semester.</p>
<p>This year’s Arts Fest offered a full day of enriching art and music experiences.
The event began with an exciting line-up of performances that captivated
the school community, setting the tone for a day of creative exploration.
Students then participated in hands-on workshops led by our very own “Art
and Music Mentors” from the upper primary levels, who shared their knowledge
and skills with their peers.</p>
<p>During recess, the school came alive with creativity and energy. Students
explored simple yet engaging arts and crafts, while others enjoyed live
performances by their schoolmates. We were also heartened by the support
of our parent volunteers, who lent their time and enthusiasm to help facilitate
the recess activities and ensure a smooth experience for all.</p>
<p>Arts Fest is designed not only to deepen students’ appreciation for the
arts but also to empower student leaders with meaningful opportunities
to guide, inspire, and shine. Through this inclusive celebration, we hope
to nurture confidence, spark joy in learning, and create lasting memories
for every child at NAPS.</p>
