Through the PAL (Programme for Active Learning) and NAME (Ngee Ann Modular Enrichment) programmes, we further develop the studentsâ€™ interest in the Aesthetics by exposing them to other genres of Visual & Performing Arts.

P1 and P2 students focus on social and emotional competencies through PAL lesson packages designed specifically with collaborative activities that will provide valuable teachable moments. NAME is introduced at P3 and P4 levels with interesting topics that are covered apart from the MIP. The semi-structured and open-ended design of NAME lessons not only help our students earn at their own pace but also develop a curiosity and love for the Arts.
