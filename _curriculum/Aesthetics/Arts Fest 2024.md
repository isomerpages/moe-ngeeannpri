<p><strong>Arts Fest 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of the school's LLP, "**GR**owing <strong>A</strong>ppreciation
for <strong>C</strong>reative <strong>E</strong>xpression," all students
had the chance to immerse themselves in the vibrant arts scene at NAPS,
marking the end of a rewarding first semester. The day was filled with
art and music activities, starting with an exciting series of performances.
Students also had the opportunity to learn something new about art and
music, guided by "Art and Music Mentors" â€” senior students who took on
leadership roles.</p>
<p>During recess, students enjoyed live performances by their peers, participated
in craft-making led by our Parent Volunteers, and admired local artwork, <em>Here They Come! 1965</em> &nbsp;by
Koeh Sia Yong from a specially designed cart brought in by The National
Gallery of Singapore.</p>

</p>
<p>We hope that this inclusive platform helps students build confidence,
embrace leadership, and champion the arts. We also aim for students to
create lasting memories of their time at NAPS through joyful experiences
of creative expression, whether learning a new skill or showcasing their
talent and passion for the arts.</p>
