The Aesthetics Department believes that every child has an innate capacity for creativity and a voice that deserves to be heard. We are committed to developing the child holistically through the provision of diverse artistic experiences to promote self-expression guided by strong values. In doing so, we encourage pupils to grace their environment with the vibrancy of their voices in advocating for the Arts via a G3 Approach – ‘_Glint, Glitter, Glow’._
