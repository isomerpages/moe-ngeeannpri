**Arts Fest 2023**

As part of the school’s LLP in “**GR**owing **A**ppreciation for **C**reative **E**xpression”, all students were given the opportunity to immerse themselves in the vibrancy of the arts at NAPS to mark the end of a fruitful first semester at school.

Students were treated to a day’s worth of art and music activities beginning with an exciting line-up of performances. After which, they also learnt something new about art and music which was introduced to them by “_Art and Music Mentors_”, a role that is taken on by students from senior levels. During recess, students even got their caricatures done by a professional, played the boomwhackers, drew their friends, and dabbled in string and marble art!

The first of its kind in Ngee Ann Primary School, this Arts Fest was conceived with the intention of giving our pupils a wider perspective of the Arts as well as to give our art and music leaders an opportunity to lead and champion the Arts.

We hope that this inclusive platform will help students build confidence and create lasting shared memories of being a student at NAPS when they experience the joy of creative expression when acquiring new knowledge or skill and showcase their talent or passion for the Arts.
