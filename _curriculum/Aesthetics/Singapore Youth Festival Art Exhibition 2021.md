To express their thoughts about the world around them, our young artists from the school’s Art Club have used their talent to put their best effort into producing the following art pieces, “***Which One Will I Be***” and “***Gearing Up For The Future***”, and “***Traditional versus Digital***” based on the theme of “Artist and Technology”. Of which, we are proud to announce that “Gearing Up For The Future” have had the honour of recognition via an E-Gallery put up by the SYF committee.  
  

_Which One Will I Be_

_“In our artwork "Which One Will I Be?", we thought of the different possible effects of spending too much time on our devices. The girl in the painting looks sad as she thinks about what she has been spending her time on. She has been playing games and going on different social media platforms instead of spending time with her family and friends. Deep in her heart, she is afraid that she will soon need to put on spectacles in order to see clearly and will start looking tired all the time and lose focus in class.”_

_Gearing Up For The Future_

_“The many colourful gears symbolise the artist’s mind, which is enhanced with the limitless possibilities offered by technological advancements. Actual parts of a computer’s CPU were added in relief to show the integration of technology in art.”_

_Traditional Versus Digital_

_“We used newspapers and plasticine to create a 3D sculpture depicting hands holding electronic devices. Nowadays, there is a need to highlight the importance of preserving physical art-making processes and skills, in the advent of digitalised art. Traditional art uses mediums such as paints and canvas which shows the authenticity, value and uniqueness of the art piece._
